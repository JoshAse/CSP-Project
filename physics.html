  <h2>Heat Transfer</h2>
  <p>
    Heat flows from warmer water to colder dry ice due to the temperature
    difference between them. This transfer occurs through conduction and
    convection, increasing the rate of sublimation of solid CO₂.

  <h2>Gas Expansion and Pressure</h2>
  <p>
    As dry ice sublimates, it produces large volumes of carbon dioxide gas.
    According to gas laws, this rapid increase in gas volume raises pressure
    inside the flexible container, leading to a sudden outward release.

      <p>
       From a physics perspective, CryoBlast relies on heat transfer and gas expansion. Thermal energy flows from the warmer water to the colder dry ice due to the temperature difference. This energy transfer accelerates sublimation, increasing the kinetic energy of CO₂ molecules.

As the solid CO₂ becomes gas, its volume expands significantly according to gas behavior principles. In a flexible container, this expansion leads to a rapid increase in internal pressure. When the gas is released, CO₂ disperses outward following fluid dynamics principles. Because carbon dioxide is denser than air, it spreads along the base of the flame, effectively displacing oxygen and reducing the flame’s temperature.

  <h2>Fluid Dynamics and Cooling</h2>
  <p>
    Carbon dioxide is denser than air, allowing it to spread along the base of
    the flame and displace oxygen efficiently. The endothermic sublimation
    process also absorbs heat, lowering the combustion temperature.

        From a physics perspective, CryoBlast relies on rapid heat transfer from
        water to dry ice, triggering sublimation. The resulting CO₂ gas expands
        rapidly, increasing pressure inside the flexible container until it is
        released outward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because CO₂ is denser than air, it spreads along the base of the flame,
        displacing oxygen efficiently. At the same time, the endothermic
        sublimation process absorbs thermal energy, lowering the temperature of
        the combustion zone.
