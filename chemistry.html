  <h2>Dry Ice Sublimation</h2>
  <p>
    Dry ice (solid CO₂) undergoes sublimation, changing directly from a solid
    to a gas without passing through the liquid phase. This phase change is
    endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat from the surrounding water and air.

  <h2>Endothermic Process</h2>
  <p>
    As heat is absorbed during sublimation, the surrounding environment cools.
    This accelerates further sublimation while simultaneously contributing to
    the cooling of the combustion zone.

  <h2>Gas Concentration</h2>
  <p>
    Rapid gas production increases local CO₂ concentration, displacing oxygen
    and suppressing combustion.

      <p>
        Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide (CO₂). Under normal atmospheric pressure, CO₂ does not exist as a liquid; instead, it undergoes sublimation, a phase change where a solid transitions directly into a gas. When dry ice is exposed to warmer surroundings—especially water—it absorbs thermal energy from the environment.
This sublimation process is endothermic, meaning it requires energy input. As heat is absorbed, the dry ice rapidly converts into gaseous CO₂, producing a large volume of gas in a short time. This rapid gas production is the chemical basis of CryoBlast, as it enables a sudden release of carbon dioxide without involving a chemical reaction or combustion.
