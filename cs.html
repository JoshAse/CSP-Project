  <h2>System Modeling</h2>
  <p>
    The CryoBlast mechanism can be represented computationally by modeling its
    inputs, processes, and outputs. This abstraction allows complex physical
    behavior to be simplified into logical stages.

  <h2>Algorithmic Representation</h2>
  <p>
    The operation follows a clear sequence: input of water and dry ice, heat
    transfer, sublimation, pressure increase, and gas release. Representing this
    process algorithmically highlights cause-and-effect relationships.

      <p>
       Computer science contributes to CryoBlast through abstraction and system modeling. The physical process can be represented as a logical sequence of inputs, processes, and outputs. Inputs include dry ice and water, processes involve heat transfer and sublimation, and the output is the rapid release of carbon dioxide that suppresses fire.

Representing the system algorithmically helps clarify cause-and-effect relationships and allows complex physical behavior to be communicated clearly. Additionally, the website itself serves as a computational artifact, applying principles such as modularity, structured navigation, and user-centered design to organize and present interdisciplinary scientific information effectively.
