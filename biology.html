  <h2>Fire Triangle and Oxygen Dependence</h2>
  <p>
    Combustion requires three components: heat, fuel, and oxygen. This concept,
    known as the fire triangle, explains why removing oxygen immediately halts
    combustion. CryoBlast functions by increasing the concentration of carbon
    dioxide, reducing oxygen availability around the flame.

      <p>
       Although fire is not a living organism, its behavior parallels biological respiration. Both combustion and aerobic respiration depend on the availability of oxygen. This relationship is described by the fire triangle, which states that fire requires heat, fuel, and oxygen to persist.

When CryoBlast releases a high concentration of carbon dioxide, oxygen levels in the surrounding area decrease. In biological systems, elevated CO₂ interferes with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Similarly, in combustion, reduced oxygen availability prevents the continuation of the reaction. This explains why CO₂ is an effective fire suppressant and highlights the importance of oxygen control in both biological and chemical systems.

  <h2>CO₂ and Respiration</h2>
  <p>
    In biological systems, oxygen is essential for aerobic respiration. Elevated
    levels of carbon dioxide interfere with oxygen intake and gas exchange.
    Although CryoBlast targets fire rather than organisms, this biological
    principle explains why CO₂ is an effective fire suppressant.

  <h2>Safety Relevance</h2>
  <p>
    High concentrations of carbon dioxide can be dangerous to living organisms,
    particularly in enclosed spaces. This reinforces the importance of treating
    CryoBlast as a conceptual design that prioritizes controlled use and safety.
